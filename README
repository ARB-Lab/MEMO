The package contains the following files:

bigg_universal_model.mat: BiGG universal model in COBRA format

metacyc_universal_model.mat: MetaCyc universal model in COBRA format

metacyc_universal_model_limonene.mat: Model as in metacyc_universal_model.mat but with additional limonene exchange reaction

bigg_CETCH_screening.m: script for screening up to 10 solutions that fulfill the CETCH requirements for each substrate in the BiGG model. Can be adapted to calculate solutions for modified CETCH requirements as well as solutions with multiple substrate uptakes.

metacyc_universal_model.m: script for screening up to 10 solutions that fulfill the CETCH requirements for each substrate in the MetaCyc model Can be adapted to calculate solutions for modified CETCH requirements as well as solutions with multiple substrate uptakes.

metacyc_limonene_screening.m: script for calculating solutions for the limonene production from glucose with a minimum yield of 1/3 limonene per glucose

Before using the scripts CellNetAnalyzer must have been started and the CPLEX setup been configured (files javalibrarypath.txt and startcna.m). In addition, set up the CPLEX remote configuration like this
cnan.cplex_remote.transport_name= 'processtransport';
cnan.cplex_remote.transport_args= {'/mechthild/home/vonkamp/CPLEX_Studio128/cplex/bin/x86-64_linux/cplex', '-worker=process'};
                                    ^^^ set this to point to your CPLEX binary
